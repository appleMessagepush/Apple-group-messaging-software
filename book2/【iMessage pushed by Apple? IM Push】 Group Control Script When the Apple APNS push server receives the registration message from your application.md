# [iMessage Apple pushes? IM Push] Group Control Script When the Apple APNS push server receives the registration message from your application, it will return a string of devicetokens for you.

IM (Instant Messaging) group sending real machine group control deployment involves group sending and group control operations of instant messaging messages on real devices. This process involves device management and control, message sending and receiving, etc. Please note that group real-device messaging and group control are sensitive areas, and you need to comply with relevant laws and regulations, respect user privacy, and ensure that they are only used in legal scenarios.

The following is a brief overview involving the basic steps to implement IM group sending and real machine group control:

Device management and connectivity:
Get a set of real iOS devices and connect them to a central control server. You can use USB connection, Wi-Fi connection or other suitable connection methods. Make sure the device has developer options enabled and allows debugging mode.

"Authorized Developers" means your employees and contractors, members of your organization, or if you are an educational institution, your teachers and employees (a) who each have an active and valid registered Apple Developer Account with Apple, (b) has a clear need to know or use Apple Software to develop and test the Covered Products, and (c) to the extent such persons will have access to Apple Confidential Information, each is protected by a written and binding agreement Such unauthorized use and disclosure of Appleâ€™s confidential information.

HomeKit Database refers to Apple's repository for storing and managing information about end-user-licensed HomeKit accessories and related information.

"iCloud" or "iCloud Service" means the iCloud online services provided by Apple, including long-distance online storage.
 
"iCloud Storage API" means an API that allows the storage and/or retrieval of user-generated files and other files, and that allows the storage and/or retrieval of key-value data (e.g., stocks, financial app lists, settings apps) and more Platform software applications by using iCloud.

API "In-App Purchase" refers to a documented API that allows additional content, functionality or services to be delivered or used within the application with or without additional fees

Device management and connectivity and connecting a set of real iOS devices to a central control server typically involves the following steps:

Get the real iOS device:
First, you need to get a set of real iOS devices. These devices can be devices running the iOS operating system such as iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch. Make sure these devices are real devices and not emulators or virtual machines.

Turn on developer options:
On each iOS device, make sure developer options are turned on. This is to allow you to debug and install unsigned applications on your device. Here are the steps to enable developer options:

a. Go to your iOS device's Settings.
b. Click "General".
c. Scroll to the bottom, find "About This Mac" and click to enter.
d. Find "Version" and click it several times until the "Developer Options Enabled" prompt appears.
e. Now return to "General", you will see the "Developer Options" option, click to enter.
f. Make sure the "Developer Options" switch is turned on.

USB connected device:
You can connect the device to the central control server via USB connection. Use the original Lightning to USB cable to connect your iOS device to the server or computer running the control software. The server or computer should already have the appropriate device drivers installed in order to recognize and communicate with the iOS device.

Wi-Fi connected devices:
Another option is to connect the device to a central control server via a Wi-Fi connection. Make sure the iOS device and the server or computer are connected to the same Wi-Fi network. Turn on Wi-Fi on your iOS device, find the Wi-Fi network in the settings, and connect to the corresponding network. Make sure the server-side or control software supports communicating with iOS devices over Wi-Fi.

You first need to define the data structure information you need to serialize in a .proto file. Each ProtocolBuffer message is a small logical record, including a series of key-value pairs. Here is a very simple .proto file that defines personal information:

 

message Person {
   required string name = 1;
   required int32 id = 2;
   optional string email = 3;
 
   enum PhoneType {
     MOBILE = 0;
     HOME = 1;
     WORK = 2;
   }
 
   message PhoneNumber {
     required string number = 1;
     optional PhoneType type = 2 [default = HOME];
   }
 
   repeatedPhoneNumber phone = 4;
}
 

   As you can see, the message structure is very simple. Each message type has one or more specific numeric fields, and each field has a name and a value type. The value type can be a number (integer or floating point), Boolean, string, raw byte or other ProtocolBuffer type, and also allows multiple levels of nesting of data structures. You can specify optional fields, required fields and recurring fields. You can find more information on how to write .proto files at (https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto).

 

 

   Once you define your own message format (message), you can run the ProtocolBuffer compiler to compile your .proto file into a language-specific class. These classes provide simple methods to access each field (such as name() and set_name()), and the same methods as the access class will serialize or deserialize the structure. For example, you can choose C++ language, run and compile the protocol file above to generate a class called Person. You can then use this class to serialize read message information in your application. You can write code like this:

 

Person person;
person.set_name("John Doe");
person.set_id(1234);
person.set_email("jdoe@example.com");
fstream output("myfile", ios::out | ios::binary);



Use appropriate device management tools:
In order to better manage connected devices and achieve group control, you can use professional device management tools or software. These tools can help you monitor the status of your devices, send commands and data, and centrally control multiple devices.

It should be noted that device management and connection as well as real machine group control are behaviors that need to be treated with caution. Make sure you have legal authority to control these devices and comply with relevant laws and regulations. Group control operations may affect devices and users, so they must be used in appropriate scenarios and respect user privacy and personal rights.
Application installation and configuration:
On each device, install the IM application and ensure that the application version and configuration are consistent. You can consider pre-setting some test accounts on the device to receive group messages.

IM protocol and API integration:
You need to integrate the corresponding instant messaging protocols and APIs in your IM application to send messages to multiple devices during group messaging. This may involve API calls to the IM service provider or developing server-side logic yourself.

Mass messaging logic:
Implement group sending logic on the server side to send messages to multiple users on the device. Pay attention to the frequency and quantity of messages sent to avoid disturbing users or sending excessive messages.

Message reception and processing:
On each device, make sure the app can receive and process group messages. This may require monitoring the arrival of messages in the application and processing and displaying them accordingly.

Security and Privacy:
Make sure your group control system has appropriate security measures to prevent information from being leaked or used by unauthorized persons. Follow the privacy policy and only perform group sending and group control operations with legal authorization.

Please note that group IM group control is a complex task and may involve some legal and ethical issues. Before performing any group control operation, please make sure you understand the relevant laws and regulations and respect the privacy of users.
