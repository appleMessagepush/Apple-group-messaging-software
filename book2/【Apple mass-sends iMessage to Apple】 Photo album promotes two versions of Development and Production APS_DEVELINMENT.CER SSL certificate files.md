Choosing protocols to use with APNs should be based on your needs, technology stack, and development environment. Here are some suggestions to help you make your choice:

HTTP/2 protocol compatibility:

If your technology stack supports HTTP/2 and your development environment can easily integrate and use HTTP/2 libraries or frameworks, then choosing HTTP/2 is a more common and recommended choice.
HTTP/2 provides higher efficiency, performance and security, and supports multiplexing and header compression, suitable for large-scale push message sending.
Applicability of binary protocol:

If your development environment or technology stack does not directly support HTTP/2, or you have better understanding and control of the custom binary protocol, then choosing the binary protocol may be more appropriate.
Using binary protocols requires a certain understanding of the protocol's specifications and details, and writing communication code that adapts to the protocol.


#Is it starting from the background? With this parameter, you can try to run it as the background.

fork=true

 

#Port number The default is 27017

port=27017

 

#Specify the hoarding engine (default does not require naming)

#storageEngine=mmapv1



Including push through Apple ID (Apple ID) and push through mobile phone number. These push methods are suitable for different scenarios and needs.

Apple ID push: Apple ID push is to send push notifications to users who log in with a specific Apple ID. This method is suitable for push notifications targeted at individual users, such as sending personalized messages or prompts to specific users. Apple ID push uses Apple's push service (APNs). You can push notifications to specific users by obtaining the user's device token (Device Token) in the application.

Mobile phone group control number push: Mobile phone group control number push is to send push notifications to a group of mobile phone numbers. This method is suitable for sending broadcast messages or notifications to a group of users. For mobile phone group control number push, you need to use an SMS service provider or a third-party push service provider to send push messages to a group of mobile phone numbers. You need to provide a list of mobile phone numbers or use the relevant interface to push numbers in batches.

Please note that the implementation and technical details of these two push methods will change over time, depending on the development language, platform and service provider you use. Apple ID push requires the use of Apple's push service (APNs), while mobile phone group control number push may need to be integrated with an SMS service provider or push service provider.

If you want to implement a specific push method, please refer to Apple's official documentation and developer resources to learn more about the detailed implementation and technical details of the corresponding push method.

The following interface will appear, click the decimal point in the upper right corner that appears below, double-click twice, and create a development test certificate and a certificate. Develop a test certificate for actual mechanical debugging. The certificate is used to deliver to the AppStore. Our development test certificate is an example. Select the content in the first red box; after that, the CSR file, that is, the certificate mark, will be prompted. To request the file, there will be a specific method, if the English is not correct, you can refer to the map; Then save the CSR file to a; Pay attention to: The CSR file makes each certificate distinguishable as much as possible, because the name of the tenant is the certificate name key in; then submit the CSR file in the Exchange Center; if submitted, a CER certificate will be generated as shown in the picture with a one-year period; configure the issued certificate using a similar method, load the save, double-click Installation; In the faculty login certificate, you can check the name of the private key. The name of the CSR request file; 2. The configuration of the developer certificate has been completed, let's configure the APPID and push the certificate; Select the AppID in the left column, select the "Correct" option, add a knob for the application, and you will see To create the button, namely the certificate and publish the certificate, the following process is the same as the certificate in 1 above. First, create the certificate request file. Then, submit it, be careful if necessary, of course you can create the push certificate directly in the certificate column on the left, but it is recommended to create the push service here to avoid forgetfulness. Not available when push service is turned on.



After creating the certificate, you will save the download and double-click to install; #Extract tar -zxvf mongodb-osx-ssl-x86_64-3.6.5.tgz #Change the command name mv mongodb-osx-x86_64-3.6.5 mongodb-3.6.5 # Add it to the environment variable vim ~/.zshrc and finally add export MONGODB_HOME=/Users/liang/software/mongodb-3.6.5 export PATH=$MONGODB_HOME/bin:$PATH #Make the configuration effective source ~/.zshrc #Check the copy mongod -version error: Prompt that cannot be opened #System Favorite Settings-->Global and Confidential-->Enable Apps that are allowed to be downloaded from the following locations: "mongod" is disabled because clicks from self-identified developers are still allowed #Reexecute mongod -version

The device serial number generated by Clover + any 5-digit pseudonymous approximate number can easily be used to create a set of radicand numbers.
For example, the serial number generated by your Clover is C02J8YTODNCT. For example, if your arbitrary 5-digit alias is: ABCDE, then fill in the Board Serial Number as: C02J8YTODNCTABCDE into the local ROM and MLB ROM in the picture below, which is your network card MAC address. For example, if the network card MAC is: A1-B2-C3-D4-E5-F6, then this ROM is: A1B2C3D4E5F6 MLB is your Board Serial Number. Just add the target value in Board Serial Number here. Custom UUID directly copies the SmUUID subsidy, and converts the phonograph network card mac address name part into an inscription. After completing the above values, as expected, you can enjoy Apple's iMessage and FaceTime functions normally after restarting - (void)applicationDidFinishLaunching:( NSNotification *)aNotification { kern_return_t kr; CFMutableDictionaryRef matchDict; io_iterator_t iterator; io_registry_entry_t entry; matchDict = IOServiceMatching("IOEthernetInterface"); kr = IOServiceGetMatchingServices(kIOMasterPortDefault, matchDict,



When choosing a protocol, also consider the following elements:

Functional requirements: Assess your push function requirements, such as whether you need to support multiplexing, header compression and other functions. Choose a protocol according to your needs.

Technology stack and development environment: Understand how your technology stack and development environment support different protocols and whether there are relevant libraries, tools or frameworks available.

Maintenance and support: Consider your teamâ€™s technical skills and resources, as well as the cost of maintenance and support for different protocols.

No matter which protocol you choose, you need to comply with Apple's push service specifications and security requirements to ensure that communication with APNs is safe and reliable.

Most importantly, carefully read Apple's developer documentation and push service-related guidance, which provide detailed instructions, sample code, and best practices to help you communicate with APNs.

I hope these suggestions can help you make a protocol choice that suits your needs! If you have any further questions please feel free to ask.
