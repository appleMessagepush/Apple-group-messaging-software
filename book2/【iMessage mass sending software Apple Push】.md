# [iMessage mass sending software, Apple push notification, fully automatic mass sending, can filter blue numbers, switch ids, and can accept two-factor authentication]

IP and port information, establish MQ connection and create producer to send messages. The receiver (front-end, client, mobile device) finds the MPS component through the service address (multi-line address method) information, and establishes a connection according to the receiving method, Websocket or friend alliance, and receives the message.

In most cases, the impact of the news does not stem from server issues on Apple's end. You can correct this problem by signing out and returning to iMessage. You'll need to log out on all devices where your account is controlled, and then log in again to each device. This is how it works.

Fire up your Settings app and then tap “Messages.”
Launch the Settings app and click Messages.

In most cases, the impact of the news does not stem from Apple's own server failure. You can correct this problem by signing out and returning to iMessage. You will need to log out on all devices on which your account is used, and then log back in to each device. This is how it works.



Some people have also reported that enabling the "Slow Actions" setting affects their ability to view message results. The "Reduce Activity" setting is designed to disable unnecessary animations, such as on the home screen. Some people turn it on because these typical animations bother them, others for the sake of or delay in battery life. If you're definitely using the "Reduce Action" setting and it's interfering with message performance, just decide which one is more important to you.

That said, many people don't experience the problem and message effects work fine even when Reduce Motion is turned on. It's an easy enough thing to check, though. Maybe it will work for you if signing out and back in to iMessage didn' t.

That said, even with Reduce Motion enabled, quite a few people don't have problems and the messages work just fine. However, this is easy to check. If you haven't logged out and logged back into iMessage, this will probably work for you.

In your Settings app, tap “General.”

In the Settings app, click Routines.

On the General settings screen, tap “Accessibility.”
On the General Settings screen, click Help Features.
On the Accessibility settings screen, see whether the “Reduce Motion” item is turned on or off. If it’s turned on, go ahead and tap “Reduce Motion.”
On the Accessibility Settings screen, check whether the Reduce Movement item is on or off. If it's already turned on, go ahead and click "Low Movement."
Now, can go test your messages again to see if effects are working. Like we said, this seems to be working for some people, but not others. So far, all the instances we've seen on our own devices were corrected by either turning Reduce Motion off or signing out and back into iMessages on your devices. So, hopefully, this will get you fixed up and sending invisible messages in no time.

Now, you can test your message again to see if the results are normal. Like we said, this seems to work for some but not others. So far, all the instances we've seen on our own devices have been fixed by turning off Resume Activity or logging out and back into iMessages on the device. So, hopefully this will allow you to manage and send invisible messages in no time.
