That said, even with Reduce Activity enabled, many people won't have problems and the message results will be fine. However, this is easy to check. If you don't log out and log back into iMessage, this may work for you.

In your Settings app, tap “General.”



Regardless of whether your application requires push emails or not, you are not getting as good a response as I can tell from your sign up. Of course, it is also recommended that you take advantage of Apple's push efficiency, 100% delivery rate, as opposed to Android being overly mixed and you can't guarantee the speed of your email delivery rate.


Not much to say, let’s start with the other party: 1. Start the board -> visit the power board!

Sign Out and Back In to iMessage on All Your iOS Devices (Sign Out and Back In to iMessage on All Your iOS Devices)
Most often, not message effects stems from a server error on Apple's end. You can correct this by signing out and back in to iMessage. You'll need to sign out on all devices your account is used on, and then sign back into each of them. Here's how to do it.


Turn Off the Reduce Motion Accessibility Setting
Some people have also reported that having the Reduce Motion setting turned on interferes with their ability to see message effects. The Reduce Motion setting is intended to disable unnecessary animations–like on your home screen. Some folks turn it on because those types of animations bother them, others to or help increase battery life. If you do use the Reduce Motion setting and it interferes with message effects, you'll just have to decide which is more important to you.

Some people have also reported that enabling the "reduced behavior" setting affects their ability to view message results. The "Reduce Motion" setting is designed to disable unnecessary animations, such as on the home screen. Some people turn it on because these types of animations annoy them, others do it to save battery life. If you're definitely using the Reduce Action setting and it's interfering with message performance, just decide which one is more important to you.

Local Notification (Local Notification) 2. Remote Notification (Remote Notification) In our daily development, we may use remote push more often. Remote push relies on the potentiometer and requires a connection to receive it. Local push does not require Connect and add a timer to send funeral notifications at a specified time. Common usage scenarios are mostly alarm clocks, reminders, etc. Here’s an idea. In particular, the iOS system limits the number of registered local pushes, with the maximum number of registrations being 64. In this video, we mainly explain local push. 2. Local Push (Local Push) You can push without being connected to the Internet. There is no need to establish a push relationship. 3. Push each other (the demonstration is based on iOS8.0 and above).
