After that, the iPhone data cable failed many times, and then you cannot display the icon in the explorer and cannot enter a copy of the original. Restarting the computer is useless; completing iTunes and restarting the computer is still useless. But when I try plugging it in with another iPhone, the icon under "Portable Devices" comes up and removes the Computer or Line title and it's nice and weird. So restart the iPhonex, then plug it into the computer and it's normal.

Both Development Push SSLCertificate and Production Push SSL Certificate are outdated. The Development Push SSL Certificate is valid for about four months (later it seems to have been changed to one year), while the ProductionPush SSL Certificate is valid for one year. Care must be taken to generate a new certificate before expiration to avoid affecting use. The official website can configure two at the same time. When the first one is about to expire, generate the second one, then replace the server certificate, and delete the first certificate setting after the second one has been used for a week without any problems.
It seems that it is not just the original problem of the iPhone. I usually like to take iPhone photos, so I back up my computer's hard drive for two to three months. But it often encounters some problems that cannot be explained. If the IOS system is blocked, it will be too troublesome and extra is new. Currently, it is estimated that new photo and video styles have been introduced. Let me comment on my experience and final solution.

After entering the password 123456abc, if everything is OK, there will be quite a few outputs, you will be able to enter multiple characters, and the input bus will be interrupted. This is the most complete, cumbersome and error-prone process, and certificate-related matters are far into the coding stage ~
