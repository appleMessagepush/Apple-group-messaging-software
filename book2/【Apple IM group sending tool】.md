If you want to use the product certificate for the first time. Because you must wait for a software release before getting a product serial number, the server serial number on the server is debugged. Third, you can find a replacement certificate that cannot connect to ApplePushServer. You must remember the address of the development certificate and the address of the product certificate,




byte[] bt = bos.tobytearray(); returnNewByTearRayInputStream(Bt, 0, bt.length); } apns; } apns; } apns; } apns; } apns; Quality of service components can be stored and sent. When sending an APN to an offline device, the APN will store the notification when the device accesses the Internet (during this period) and then pass it to the device. This storage only stores the latest notifications from a device application. If the device is offline, notifications sent to the device will be unlocked for future storage notifications. If the device is offline for an extended period of time, all notifications stored on the device will be dismissed. Keep the exported private key file for picking the stack, then import the private key username selection. Click "Save APNS-14.PNG15" for P12 style. If necessary, configure optional bean encoding protection for .p12 files. You can set a protection password for storing .p12 files. "" means then between the situation situation situation setting" app and click "Messages". iMessage address... address mark symbol "signature". Messages" messages message account account pop -up pop -up center and middle ( 1) The application process first calls and closes, for example, the terminal executes "activeClose". At this point, TCP sends a fin to instruct the data to be sent. The data received by the application process, and the takeover process means that there is no remaining data about the receiver's application process response connection. (3) After a while, the application process at the end of the document will approach the closing of its jet. This fin is confirmed by the tip of the TCP fin. Celestial body prevention and control: TCP provides a reliable method of information transmission in unreliable collection environments. To this end, it has added many mechanisms, such as traffic control, congestion control and congestion. Selective response: During TCP communication, if the data packet in the middle of the sequence is lost, TCP will re-confirm the final confirmation packet in order to repeat and accurately transmit the data packet, and the TCP performance is greatly reduced.





As well as many speaking lengths and connection addresses. topic. Fourth, if you use the serial number of your development certificate, you will hold the test in ServerPushmebaby, then find it and click Trip. The solution is to quickly publish the current software, download it using a test phone, allow the background to obtain a serial number, and then use this serial number as a debugging serial number for the background product certificate. Actually, this method is the second point, but the problem is still stuck. Fifth, Apple's push for a C++ server is different from PHP. PHP essential secret certification and development CK.PEM. OBJC does not directly develop certificates. In background C++ engineer. It is used as separate files for PuppHchatkey.pem and epphchachatcert.pem. Pupphchatkey.pey.pem and Pupphchatcert.pem can also be modified How to exchange using Applapn? iOS developers will download APS_Production.cer for server developers from the Appledeveloper website;
