# 【Apple pushes group sending iMessage to real machine script】

1. Detailed steps for packaging ipa and generating .plist files:
1. Generate a signature file in the Apple developer background and use the developer profile or adhoc distribution profile. Note that the distribution profile cannot be used because it is not published to the Appstore.
2. Generate an archive and click the archive option in the product menu bar to package it.
3. Click archive in the organizer to distribute. During the publishing process, be careful to select save for enterprise distribution, otherwise it will fail. After saving, two files, .ipa file and .plist file, will be generated. The .ipa file is the application file, and the .plist file is the file that Apple needs to access through the itms-services protocol.

Below is the style of the .plist file


if (NSFoundationVersionNumber >= NSFoundationVersionNumber_iOS_7_0) {
     // >= iOS 7.0
} else {
     // < iOS 7.0
}

perhaps:

if (kCFCoreFoundationVersionNumber >= kCFCoreFoundationVersionNumber_iOS_7_0) {
     // >= iOS 7.0
} else {
     // < iOS 7.0 At the top, click the address where you want to manipulate iMessage login. In the MessageAccount pop-up window, click Signature. In the "Motion" pop music window, click "Exit". If it looks good, continue to repeat the last few steps side by side to log into iMessage on any device. If it looks good, go ahead and repeat the last few steps to log in to iMessage on other devices. Turn on the facility settings to view the results of being able to view information. Reduce manipulation settings to strip UNN EFESSARY cartoons - for example, on your home screen. Some people opened it,

2. Now everything is ready and all we need is spring breeze. We only need the client to successfully access the .plist file we generated.
I originally thought it was the same as an ipa file. It was OK to put it on the server and access it. It turned out that the latest version was not available. In the past, the plist file could be accessed through http for installation, but now Apple stipulates that it must be accessed through http. https method to access.

Solution to access plist files via https

1. Set up the device to arrange tomat to support https access.
2. Use dropbox to share external links to access the original files
3. Use open source China's git&osc to share external links to access original files

Let’s talk about three methods. The first method: For tomcat that only uses http access to configure, it is expensive and unnecessary to change the configuration yourself.
The second method: dropbox is from abroad, and it needs to be circumvented, which means it is unstable and not universal.
The third way: Domestic websites, simple and not messy


 
Since those typical animations are disruptive to them, other animations are meant to or help extend battery pack life. If you really use the reduction in control settings, it will affect the message results if you determine which one is more important to you. Some people have also reported that it can "reduce action" setting affects them to see the message effect. If you have "action" and it's going to interfere with you, you can use it to make it more tense for you. Title and message effects can work even if you turn on "Reduce Activities." But this is easy to check. If you log out and log into IMESSAGE, you will be able to use IMESSAGE. Even with "reduced activity," many people will never have a problem, and the messaging works well. But it is easy to check. your settings, click Conventional. In the Settings app from the Public screen, click Accessibility. On the Accessibility screen, click Accessibility. If it's flowering, click "Reduce Mental Education." On the Help Obedience Settings screen,
