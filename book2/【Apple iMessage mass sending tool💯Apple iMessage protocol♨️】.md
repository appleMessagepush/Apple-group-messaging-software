After uniquely marking the processes in the network, they can communicate using sockets. What is a socket? We often translate socket as socket. Socket is an abstraction layer between the application layer and the transport layer. It abstracts the complex operations of the TCP/IP layer into several simple interfaces for the application layer to call the implemented process on the network. Communication.

The difference between Telnet and Socket connection
Different application layers have different connection establishment processes. Socket connection establishment is the same as TCP - only three handshakes are needed to complete the connection. However, some applications need to exchange a lot of information to successfully establish a connection, such as the Telnet protocol, which is completed in the TCP three-way handshake. Finally, option negotiation is required before the Telnet connection is established.


System.out.println(m.get()); /* The thread "main" is very java.lang.ClassCastException: NewsImpl InFa. Unable to cast to IMessage with main (InFa.java:33) The change is very * / INews mn = new NewsImpl(); IMessage m1 = (IMessage) mn; System.out.println (mn.get());}} 3) Place savings funds for the cooperative. Our main focus is to prepare the application for local potentiometer distribution using an enterprise-level account 4), which saves testing for the development design mainly on the developer device (the details will be added to the developer account). Develop and compile application packages. Currently provided for unified testing and packaging. The test environment and Xiangyang situation are all packaged. The third method (remained as Enterprise Deployment), such an installation package can be installed in the entire location of the iPhone, which is very useful for testing the deployment experience of employees of companies such as publishing malls. In a ME environment, the second method uses packaging (save as temporary configuration), and the second method uses the same publishing certificate. The destination certificate is sent to the App Store. , you can use the same outbound certificate, so you can test whether there are any problems with the outbound process of your ME environment. This way, the packager is used for devices like this: Add it to your device account, {implementation'org.aspectj: aspectjrt: 1.8.14'implements' com.github.

Telnet connection and

Socket mainly refers to the transport layer protocol, including TCP, UDP, and SCTP; while TELNET is an application layer protocol, which is an upper layer protocol based on the transport layer protocol.

Being able to connect through telnet only means that the host has enabled the telnet service and has started telnet server monitoring on the corresponding port. Therefore, when a client connects, the connection can be established normally.

The distinction between two provisioning profiles is that they have very different device constraints and use the same relationships. interface IMessage1 {void print(); void getMsg() {/* is the activation method, jdk1.8 * /System.out.println("I am a universal method of interface 1");} static void Will be happy later into. getMss(){System.out.println("I am a method of interface 1");


1. Nowadays, using multi-channel IO multiplexing epoll, etc., a server with better configuration can support hundreds of thousands of concurrent connections, but the port number is only 16 digits, with a maximum of 65535, and some commonly used port numbers cannot be added. Application, there are not so many available port numbers.

2. Most servers now use firewalls, which only open specific ports. If accept randomly assigns port numbers, it will not be able to pass the firewall.

In the TCP/IP protocol, the IP protocol is an end-to-end protocol. It is only responsible for sending data to the end and delivering it to the upper layer. The transport layer TCP and UDP add port numbers to distinguish different applications.

Program package overview 2.1 Introduction to how to package an Apple program 1) Save it locally and upload it to the App Store, or Use on an escaped iOS device 2) Save it locally and add the application package through the account. The application package is published and ready to be used on the device (developer account added device). // It is recommended to add a marker interface. The interface and class definition must be consistent. IMessage {public static final String MSG = "You will understand in the first issue of Baidu"; public abstract void print(); // Ambiguous method} Interface INews {public abstract String get();} MessageImpl class IMessage.
