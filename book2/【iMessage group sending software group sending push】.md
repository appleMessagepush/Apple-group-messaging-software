Implementation of iMessage push technology Mass sending iMessage mainly requires overcoming two technical difficulties, one is the acquisition of iMessage account, and the other is mass sending iMessage.

Obtain iMessage account. The current way to obtain iMessage account is mainly to scan the mobile phone number. Scanning mobile phone numbers can be done automatically through code scanning or through wild screening. No good method has been found yet through automatic code scanning. It is recommended that you start from the following two aspects:

· 1. Write an AppleScript script to control the iMessage client that comes with Mac OS for verification, which is similar to group sending iMessage. After sending an iMessage, if you catch the exception that failed to send, it is not the iMessage account.

· 2. Study the public API in the Message framework in the iOS system and verify it through the private API

To perform manual selection, you can also use the iMessage client that comes with Mac OS. The method is to write a program that outputs the numbers to be verified to a file, separated by commas. Then paste the number in the file into the address bar of the iMessage client. The iMessage client will automatically check whether the number is an iMessage account one by one. The checking speed depends on the network speed. Red means it is not an iMessage account, blue means iMessage accounts and unverified accounts.


3. After Messages is opened, you can see the contents of the messages in your account;
4. After clicking Messages, find the Messages menu bar at the top left side, click the "Messages" option, and find "Preferences" in the drop-down menu bar.

Just use the first development unified examination development certificate and development certificate description document (no push certificate required), but please remember to select the Pushnotification variable on the development tool. 14.
