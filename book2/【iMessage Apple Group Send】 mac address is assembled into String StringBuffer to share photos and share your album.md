# [iMessage Apple Group Send] Mac address is assembled into String StringBuffer to share photos and share your album

To put this into perspective, no matter what your application is, if you don't need to send an email, you will, as I said, not respond to your request. Of course, it is also recommended that you take advantage of Apple's push feature, 100% arrival rate, and without going overboard with Android, you have no way to guarantee the speed of your email.



After that, the iPhone data cable failed many times, and then you can't display the icon in the explorer and can't input a copy of the original. Restarting the computer is useless; completing iTunes and restarting the computer is still useless. But when I try plugging it in with another iPhone, the icon under "Portable Devices" comes out, indicating a computer or cord issue, and it's nice and weird. So restart the iPhonex, then plug it into the computer and it's normal.

But the problem of copying photos and videos still exists. It will be prompted later: even if the device on the system does not have a playback role. Then the copy breaks and I don't know how much it was copied, which is very troublesome. Withdraw, the problem remains, as if it were not a single situation, the problem always exists.
Searching online, many problems were found and solutions were found.

iOS11 future systems will have this problem. Because iOS11 has increased the contraction pattern. By default photos and videos are captured in the new format. If you don't make mistakes, it's called HEVC. Due to the introduction of new formats, the size of shots and videos can be greatly reduced. When connected to the computer using a data cable, the format will be automatically converted to the computer. Therefore, the exit speed is very slow. That's why the volume copied from pictures and videos will be louder.

Solution, input, camera, format, select "Compatibility", the default is efficient, select "Compatibility" videos and images do not use the new HEVC format, continue to use the old MPEG format. Exporting videos and pictures will not convert the format and will have the above reminder.
Or, enter "Device photo", see bottom, change "Auto" to "Keep original photo". You can also protect against replication errors. Because of the change, the format will not be converted and the new format file will be copied directly. Once you see that, I will see that your computer CPU is not giving power, so the CPU decoding result is decoding in the new format.
My solution was to change the format to "Compatibility" and then transfer to "Reserve Original Photos". The problem was solved!
