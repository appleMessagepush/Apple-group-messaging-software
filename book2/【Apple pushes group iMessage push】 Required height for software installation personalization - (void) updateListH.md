iMessage is an instant messaging service provided by Apple to its device users, with a series of powerful functions and features. However, so far, Apple has not provided an official mass deployment function. iMessage is primarily designed as a peer-to-peer communication tool, that is, users can have private chat conversations with one or more people. Here are some discussions and suggestions for iMessage mass deployment.

Group chat function: Although iMessage does not have a dedicated group messaging function, it supports group chat. You can create a group with multiple contacts where you can discuss and communicate. The group chat feature lets you message multiple people at once and have a group conversation with them.

Add contacts: Before creating a group chat, you need to add the contacts you want to add to the group to your contact list. This way you can select and add people from your contact list when creating a group.

Create a group: Open the iMessage app, tap the option to create a new conversation or group chat, and select the contacts you want to add to the group. You can choose a name in a group chat to distinguish and identify the group. After you create a group, you can communicate with its members by sending messages to the group.

Group management: As the creator or administrator of a group, you can manage and control the group. You can add or remove group members, change the group name, and disable or enable certain group features if needed. This way, you maintain control of the group and ensure a good group communication experience.

Note: Although iMessage does not provide official mass deployment function, you can try the following methods to perform similar operations.

a. Send in batches: If you want to send the same message to a large number of contacts, you can divide the contacts into smaller groups and send the message in batches. Although this requires some additional operations, it can still achieve the purpose of sending messages to multiple people.

b. Use shortcut phrases: iMessage provides a shortcut phrase function. You can preset some commonly used phrases or templates, and then select and send them when you need to send a message. This saves you the time and effort of typing the same thing on every contact.

c. Third-party tools: Although iMessage itself does not have an official group messaging function, you can try to use third-party applications or tools to achieve group messaging. Some applications may offer more advanced group messaging capabilities that suit your needs. But be sure to be aware of security and privacy issues and carefully evaluate the



For the batch sending method of iMessage, you can follow the steps below to group contacts and send messages in batches:

Open the Contacts app: On your iPhone or iPad, find and open the Contacts or Phone app. Your contact list is stored here.

Create a contact group: Browse your contact list and select the contacts you want to add to the group list. You can divide these contacts into smaller groups to make it easier to manage and send messages. For example, you can create a group called "Friends" and a group called "Family."

Add a contact to a group: On the selected contact, find and select an "Add to group" or "Move to group" option. Select the group you want to add to from the list that appears. Repeat this step to add all relevant contacts to the appropriate groups.

Open the iMessage app: Return to the Home screen and find and open the "Messages" or "iMessage" app. This is the application you use to send messages.

Create a new message: Click the "New Message" button in the upper right corner (usually a box plus sign or a pencil icon). This will open a new message window.



Select a contact group: In the new message window, click the field for entering recipients and start typing the group name. iMessage will automatically display matching contact groups. Select the contact group you want to send the message to.

Write and send a message: In the message box, enter the message you want to send. You can enter text, emojis, images, or other media. Once you're ready to send your message, click the Send button.

Repeat steps: Repeat steps 6 and 7 to send messages to other contact groups. You can send to one group at a time and then move on to the next group.

This way, you can send the same message to different groups of contacts in batches. While this requires some extra work, it accomplishes the purpose of sending messages to multiple people and is more efficient than sending messages individually. Please make sure to double-check the contact group you selected before sending the message to avoid sending the message to the wrong recipient by mistake.
