ApplePhehNotificiedSL (Aquarium and Manufacturing) Contact, Wireless Phone or Productuon Select ApplePushNotificationservices to select ApplePushNotificationservices for your needs. You should click Continue. Here, you should pay attention to the correct certificate model. Very important: the DeviceToken generated using DevelopProvisionProfile can only be used in conjunction with SandBoxApnsServer (development environment management). Apps deviceToken and productapnsserver can only be used in conjunction with (production version): some tenants reported using push certificates in conjunction with (ApplePushNotificiberServices) and using the test environment in the debugger, saving the issue.

deviceToken is an identification code generated by APNs specifically to retrieve the App on your certain wireless phone. Â· deviceToken may change, if you change the bundle Identifier of your category or the APNs server is updated. In order to achieve success through simple efforts, we must first configure the equipment and arrange the relationship, adjust and publish the relationship and configuration files, which will not be detailed here.

Save the exported private key file to select the storage location, and then enter the collection private key file name selection. Click "Save APNS-14.png15" for P12 style. If necessary, set up optional password protection for .p12 files. You can set a password protection for stored .p12 files. Then click "Indirect Click Password" without setting a password. APNS-15.png Now you have a .p12 format file that contains the private key used to establish SSL with Apple's APNS accelerator /TLS secure communication. You can upload this .p12 file to your push server and configure your device to schedule it.


ProvisioningProfile provides all the files above: certificate, AppID and device. To package or run an application on a real machine, you need a certificate mark to identify this application as legal, safe, and complete; after that, you need to indicate its AppID and check whether the BundleId is the same; similarly, if necessary Confirming whether the equipment can run the program is true machine debugging. The ProvisioningProfile is packaged so that it can be used during debugging and release, simply by selecting different provisioning profile files in different situations. In the package, the ProvisionProfile file will be embedded in the .IPA. For example, as shown below, the developed ProvisioningProfile includes new results corresponding to the AppID, available certificates, and devices. This method uses this provisioning service package and must have the appropriate certificates and run the application to the device included in the application. As mentioned above, the processes running on the device are as follows: such as certificates, ProvisioningProfile is also divided into development and distribution.

Create your application (if already created, see step 6) Click "Inherit". 6. If you already have an application, enter the identifier to find your application, click to click after entering the edit mode , check the push image to save.7, enter the development certificate application field:!


DevelopAppDevelopment (1 year): For developing and really dull debugging applications. Pushdevelopment (1 year): for debugging ApplePushNotification2, ProductAdhoc: for publishing ADHOC applications. appstore: Used to publish submitted apps to the appstore. Push (1 year): For use in release builds with ApplePushNotification 1.2, the AppidAppid should be equivalent or married to the BundleId in Xcode.

Board Serial Number Board Serial Number is a set of parameters that include the device serial number generated by Clover + any 5-digit letters or numbers.

For example, the serial number generated by your Clover is C02J8YTODNCT. For example, any 5-digit letter of yours is: ABCDE. Then the Board Serial Number is: C02J8YTODNCTABCDE. Fill in the place in the picture below.
