# [Apple group iMessage push location push] The software installation will create a WebSocket connection according to the Developer Program [WebSocket]

Deploying group control push on a PC virtual machine and simulating Apple iMessage push messages is a relatively complex task. Since Apple's iMessage service is based on Apple devices and operating systems, simulating iMessage push needs to consider Apple's ecosystem and security mechanisms.

The following is one possible approach, but please note that this is an advanced setup that requires technical knowledge and specific environment setup:

Create a virtual machine: Use a virtualization platform (such as VMware, VirtualBox) to create a macOS virtual machine and ensure that the configuration of the virtual machine meets the minimum requirements for running macOS.

Install macOS: Install the macOS operating system on a virtual machine. You can use the macOS installation image provided by Apple and install it in the usual way.

Set up a network connection: Make sure the virtual machine has a network connection that can access the Internet. Depending on your network configuration, you may need to set up the virtual machine's network adapter and network settings.

Register a developer account: To simulate iMessage push, you need to have an Apple developer account, and the push certificate and push service must be set up in the developer account.

Develop push functionality: Use development tools such as Xcode to develop an app and implement iMessage push functionality in the app. Make sure you follow Apple's push service guidelines to set it up and obtain the required push certificates.

Configure the virtual machine environment: Install and configure development tools (such as Xcode) in the virtual machine, as well as the required development environment and dependencies.

Run and test: Run the developed application in a virtual machine and send push messages to the application using simulated push certificates. You can use the push simulation feature provided by the developer tools to send simulated iMessage push messages.

Please note that this is just an overview of the steps and there are many details and configuration settings involved. You may want to refer to Apple's developer documentation and guides for detailed steps and requirements.

In addition, in order to simulate iMessage push, you need to understand Apple's push service and related development technologies, as well as relevant knowledge of application development.

It is recommended that you ensure you have the relevant technical knowledge and read Apple's official documentation and guides before proceeding with this advanced setup to ensure proper setup and operation.




But the problem of copying photos and videos still exists. Later, a reminder will appear: Even if the device on the system does not play this role. Then the copy stopped, I don't know how many times it was copied, which was very troublesome. Retreating, the problem is still that it does not seem to be a single environment, the problem always exists. Search online, many problems, inventions and solutions

Systems after iS11 will have this problem. Since iOS11 adds compact format. Photos and videos are captured in the new format by default. If you're not mistaken, it's called HEVC. Because of the new format, the size of shooting and video can be greatly reduced. When using a data cable to a computer, the format is automatically converted to the computer. Therefore, the exit speed is very slow. That's why copies will be made from image and video volumes.

Solution, Input, Camera, Format, select "Compatibility", the default value is Efficient, select compatibility videos and images without using the new format, inherit the old MPEG format. Exporting videos and images will not convert formats and will have the above prompts.

Or, enter "Configure Photo", see bottom, change "Automatic" to "Link to original photo". You can also prevent replication errors. Due to the change, the format will not be converted and the new format file will be copied directly. Once you see that, I see that your computer CPU is not giving power so the new format is decoding CPU decoding efficiency.

My approach was to change "Compatibility" with the format and then move to "Saving Original Photos", which solved the problem.



I usually like to take iPhone photos, so I back up my iPhone photos, so I back up my computer's hard drive. Three months. However, it often encounters some unexplainable problems. It would be too annoying if the iOS system was closed, especially the new ones. Currently, new photo and video formats are expected to be introduced. Let me talk about my resume and ultimate solution.

I entered the computer on iPhone

Once logged in, you can copy photos. But then "even the devices on the system" are the following:

Fragmentation issues: For piles, frequent new/deletion will lead to non-sustained memory space, leading to a lot of fragmentation, which reduces program efficiency. For the stack, there is no such problem, since the stack is the first queue, it is one of them, so it will never have the memory block from the center of the stack.

Assignment: The heap is dynamically allocated, there is no static allocation of the stack. There are two types of allocation: static allocation and dynamic allocation. Static allocation is a compiler implementation, such as deflection variables. The AlloCA function allocates dynamic allocation, but dynamic allocation and stack stack are different. Its dynamic allocation is announced by the compiler without implementing it.

Allocation efficiency: The stack is a data structure provided by the machine system. The computer provides support in the underlying stack: it allocates the address of the stack, the stack within the stack has special instructions, and this specification determines the efficiency of the stack. . The stack is provided by the C/C++ function library, and its mechanism is very complex. 5. Object-c memory management? When you create an object using the new Alloc Replication method, and the object's save count has a retention counter value of 1 and is set to automatically release, you do not need to perform any operations to ensure that the object is cleared. If it completes during the era of this object, you need to preserve it and ensure the operation completes. If you have retained objects, you need to (eventually) release or autorelease the objects. You must keep the number of reserved methods and usage methods.
