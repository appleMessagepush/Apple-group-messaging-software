iPhone "Even though the device is on the system is not working" analysis and solutions it seems like you are just encountering an iPhone copy. I usually like to take iPhone photos, so I back up my iPhone photos, so I back up my computer's hard drive. Three months. However, it often encounters some unexplained problems. It would be too annoying if iOS system is shut down, especially new ones. Currently, the new photo and video format is expected to be introduced. Let me talk about my experience and final solution.

I entered the computer on iPhone

Once logged in, you can copy photos. But then "even the devices on the system" are as follows:

After collecting the iPhone data cable multiple times, then you cannot display the icon in the explorer and you cannot enter a copy of the copy. Restarted computer, no use; finished iTunes, restarted computer, still no use. But when I try to plug it in with another iphonese, the icon under "portable devices" comes out, ruling out computer or line issues, it's ok, weird. So restart your iPhone, then plug it into your computer and it's normal.

Both Development Push SSLCertificate and Production Push SSL Certificate have expiration times. The Development Push SSL Certificate is valid for about four months (it seems to have been changed to one year later), while the ProductionPush SSL Certificate is valid for one year. It is necessary to pay attention to generating a new certificate before expiration to avoid affecting use. The official website can set two at the same time. When the first one is about to expire, generate the second one, then replace the server certificate, and delete the first certificate setting after the second one has been used for a week without any problems. @property (class, readonly, strong) NSThread *currentThread;

SSL certificate, we put it on the desktop. After double clicking, you will be redirected to keychain access, the steps we followed in SSL Push Certificate are the same.


Configure the certificate to download four times. After selecting the configuration configuration, click "Note AppID" and then after the program changes the download button, we click "Download". Download, double-click and update the profile on your device (it's best to remove all deletes and then install to prevent errors). Open Keykest access with five access keys from the keychain, find our private secret (the name of the key is the public name we filled in. We start generating the CSR request), right click "Exit" on "Filename Export". We are called As a push you enter the password to encrypt the file. Here we choose abcabc, of course, you can also choose what it is, but you have to remember this password, remember! Then enter the password of the computer and click Allow. In this way, we Generate a push.p12 file on the desktop. For this we have three files on the desktop. One is the CSR request file, one is the SSL certificate file for APS_DEVELINMENT.CER and a PASH.P12 key has just been generated. Now we The preparations have been completed. To start processing the generated files. We explained the reason above, because our service links
