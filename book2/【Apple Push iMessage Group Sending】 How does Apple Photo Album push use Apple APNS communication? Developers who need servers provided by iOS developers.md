Group Ideology Many of these are piecemeal and have to be sent out, but are not as good as group ministry level solutions. But you can implement the following scenario! Because it is a batch, each account is unique, so many software and hardware devices and Apple IDs can be configured by installing a virtual machine. ​leung@wuyujin ~ % leung@wuyujin ~ % vi ~/.zshrc leung@wuyujin ~ % leung@wuyujin ~ % more ~/.zshrc # alias list alias l="ls -G " alias ll="ls -alG " # JDK export JAVA_HOME=/System/Volumes/Data/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_291.jdk/Contents/Home/ export CLASSPATH=.:$JAVA_HOME\lib:$JAVA_HOME\jre\lib export PATH=$JAVA_HOME :$PATH leung@wuyujin ~ % leung@wuyujin ~ % touch ~/.zshrc leung@wuyujin ~ % leung@wuyujin ~ % echo $JAVA_HOME /System/Volumes/Data/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_291.jdk /Contents/Home/ leung@wuyujin ~ % echo $CLASSPATH .:/System/Volumes/Data/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_291.jdk/Contents/Home/lib:/System/Volumes/Data/Library/ Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_291.jdk/Contents/Home/jrelib leung@wuyujin ~ % echo $PATH /System/Volumes/Data/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_291.jdk/Contents/Home/:/ usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/Library/Apple/usr/bin leung@wuyujin ~ % which java /usr/bin/java leung@wuyujin ~ % which javac /usr/bin/javac leung@wuyujin ~ % java -version java version "1.8.0_291" Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_291-b10) Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.291- b10, mixed mode) leung@wuyujin ~ % javac -version javac 1.8.0_291 leung@wuyujin ~ % Select "SMS software" and open the slider "Add batch by default".

2: Operation steps
The use of apn is not complicated, but links that often go wrong, especially certificate applications, require special attention.

I follow the actual steps in the following tutorial:

Organized by:

Answer: For an Xcode style, we named it MyPushChat, corresponding to the AppID.

B: A table can be used to debug iOS devices (apn can only work in the physical device simulator and cannot run)

Click "Inherit", set the "MyPushChat" file name, and click Store. In this way, a file is called "MyPushChat. This document is CertSigningRequest" and should be kept properly.

The newly created private key CSR file is everywhere, and the specific operation is shown in the following figure:

The exported file is named MyPushChatKey p12. Enter the password. Please remember this password. We will set it to 123456 American Broadcasting Company (ABC).

At this point, we have a file MyPushChat certSigningRequest, and MyPushChatKey.P1

Step 2:
To find and match the MyPushChat AppID AppIDs, click the "Configure" button on the right, and check the checkbox as shown:

Click the DevelopmentPushSSLCertificate configuration button on the right side of the application. The development version is in testing, is only valid for one year, can only use Apple's lead test server, and the application needs to apply for a release release certificate. The development and distribution of certificate tokens is not the same. A pop-up box appears as follows:
MACverifiedOK

Save part of the screenshot to the desktop command shift 4

 

Save full screen capture to clipboard command control shift 3

Save department screenshot to clipboard command control shift 4

The default save location of the above screenshot is Desktop

defaults write com.apple.screencapture location /path/;killall SystemUIServer

defaults write com.apple.screencapture location ~/Desktop/;killall SystemUIServer

But the screenshot method below cannot be annotated, so use WeChat screenshot annotation result ctrl+cmd+a screenshot annotation


After loading the certificate file, you should generate the certificate. Click the Download button to open the downloaded certificate file, typically .apns-11. PNG12 Retrieve the certificate and private key to the newly opened certificate in the keychain, then click the three right sides to expand the certificate and display the corresponding private key APNS-12.png13. Use the private copy below to import a private copy of a critical public copy. Click on the private key section and click "Export frequency name" APNS-13.PNG14.

Click "Save APNS-14.png15" for P12 style.
