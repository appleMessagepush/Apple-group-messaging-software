# [iMessage delivery requirements: Use Apple mobile phone to register ID] This requires confidentiality certificate and development certificate integration CK.PEM

The name is best used together with the file name of the AppID. If the settings are incorrect, tokens may be generated. # Add the following content, please check your own path SCALA_HOME=/Users/kylewhite/dev/scala-2.12.14 export PATH=$PATH:$SCALA_HOME/bin if it is on your processor. There are two types of credentials, such as a store account in your computer and a developer account for your company. There's no need to feel like you can use CSR without having to request it twice using two different email addresses. To change the frequency, the CSR email address must be similar to the AppID to which the certificate belongs. If you can draw tokens in the program, the program is successful. Second, use PushMebaby to push the service. Note that his serial number must comply with his production space format (if you use it directly). From then on, the serial number generated by the development certificate had to correspond first and last to the development certificate. If you want to use the product certificate for the first time. Because you must wait for the software version before getting the product serial number, adjust the server serial number on the server. Third, you can find a way to replace the certificate. It will not connect to the Apple Push Server. You must remember the address of the development certificate and the address of the product certificate, as well as many languages ​​that will calculate the connection address size. title. Fourth, if you use the serial number of the development certificate, you will find it on Server Pushmebaby and click on the three buttons. The solution is to quickly release the current software, load it using your test phone, let the background get the serial number, and then use this serial number to get the debug serial number for the background product certificate. In essence, this method is the second point, but this question is still stuck. Sixth, Apple's push to a C++ server is different from PHP, which requires a secret verification and development certificate and CK.PEM. Objc does not directly develop certificates. In process with senior engineer with background C++. It is used by pushchatkey.pem and pushchatcert.pem as separate files.

Distribution function: The warehouse is the data structure provided by the mechanical system. The computer provides support in the underlying stack: it allocates the address of the stack, the stack within the stack has additional instructions, and this description determines the efficiency of the stack. . The stack is provided by the C/C++ function library, and its mechanism is very complex. 5. Tool-c memory management? When you create an object using the new Alloc Replication method, the object's retention count has a retention counter value of 1 and is configured to automatically release, there is no need to perform any operations to ensure that the object is cleared. If completed during this object, you need to retain it and ensure the operation completes. If you have reserved objects, you need to (eventually) publish or proactively release the objects. You must keep the number of reserved methods and used methods.

Fourth, if you use the serial number of the development certificate, you will test on Server Pushmebaby, you will invent it, click on the three folds. The solution is to quickly release the later software, use your test phone to download it, let the background get the serial number, and then use this serial number as the debug serial number for the background product certificate. In fact, this method is the second point, but the problem is still stuck.

Fifth, Apple pushes the C++ server differently than PHP, which requires a confidentiality certificate and development certificate to integrate CK.PEM. Objc does not directly develop certificates. In the process with a background C++ engineer. It is used by pushchatkey.pem and pushchatcert.pem as separate files.

The pushchatkey.pey.pem and pushchatcert.pem names can also be edited arbitrarily.

How to communicate using Apple APNS? Developers who need servers provided by iOS developers

APS_Production.CER is downloaded from the Apple Developer website;
The typical Ethernet frame of IP datagram is also 0x0800 (IPv4: 0x0800) printf("not ethernet packet\n"); // If ether_type (typical) is wrong for ip datagram, an error will be reported (Copyright ©All Rights Reserved) return 1; } ptr = eth_header->ether_shost; int i = 0; printf("\nMy Physical Adress(MAC):"); while(i < ETHER_ADDR_LEN){ // The number of bytes in an ethernet (MAC) address. // #define ETHER_ADDR_LEN 6 printf(" %x:", *ptr++); i++; } printf("\n"); return 0; } stuck in a rut
In fact, every course has it), let's first look at a summary of Apple's explanation of its push. The provider is an accelerator that sends push messages to your mobile applications, and APNS (ApplePushNotificationService) is the Apple message push server

There are two paradigms of allocation: dynamic allocation and static allocation. Static allocation is a compiler completion, such as a deflection variable. The AlloCA function allocates dynamic allocation, but dynamic allocation and stack stack are different. Its dynamic allocation is enacted by the compiler without implementing it.

For warehouses, it is automatically managed by lightning arresters. There is no need to control it; for the heap, release events are under programmer control, and MemoryLeaks can be easily generated. Application size: Stack: Under Windows, the stack is a data structure that extends to a low address, which is a continuous memory area. This sentence represents the system that the address of the warehouse and the maximum traffic volume of the warehouse are pre-specified. Under Windows, the stack size is 2M (more text is 1M), to summarize the fixed constant size is limited to the available virtual memory in the processor system. You can go around it, the space gained is flexible, it is relatively large .


One question, and I'm going to get this right first, is that whether or not your application requires push email, you just follow what I'm saying and it has no impact on your application. Of course, it is also recommended that you use Apple's push function, which has a 100% delivery rate, rather than Android being overly mixed and you cannot guarantee the speed of email delivery. Without further ado, here’s the official start: 1. Start Board -> Keyboard Access! [Insert image here]


Create your application (if already created, see step 6) Click "Insert". 6. If you already have an application, enter the identifier to find your application, click to enter the edit mode after , check the push image retention.7, enter the open certificate application field:!


Fragmentation problem: For piles, frequent new/deletion will inevitably lead to unsustainable memory space, resulting in a large amount of fragmentation, which reduces program efficiency. For the stack, there is no such problem, because the stack is the first queue, it is one of them, so it will never have the memory block from the middle of the stack.



Assignment: The heap is allocated dynamically, and the stack is not dynamically allocated. There are two paradigms of allocation: static allocation and dynamic allocation. Static allocation is a compiler completion, such as a deflection variable. AlloCA function allocates dynamic allocation, but dynamic allocation and stack stack are different. Its dynamic allocation is announced by the compiler without implementing it.


8 Edit button will appear, as shown below: Click "Edit" to enter the following image: If you created the following image in the Trust Certificate (Development, Release) action, you will have the same image as above, and then you will go back. Click on buttons 1 and 2.

10. Create a development certificate description file to screen your application for disadvantages:

11. Create a publication certificate and check the post certificate, as shown in Figure 12. Use the above four certificates, 2 description files, and certificate file download description files to generate p12 files. Download the graphic in the figure. Four certificates, download the certificate, double-click to enter the application "keychain" is the exported development certificate, the export operation of the three certificates is the same as the above entry, there is no screenshot description.


13. Just use the first development test development certificate and development certificate description document (no push certificate required), but please remember to select the Pushnotification function on the development tool.

14. After publishing, you just need to use the certificate and publish the certificate description file (no publishing required).

15If you use a third-party email push service, you usually need to upload a PEM sample file.
System ("ipconfig") such a complement is not allowed to appear * But I don't want to access the network card or anything, so what should I do? *


macbookpro@MrKings-MacBook-Pro ~ % cd Tomcat/ApacheTomcat/bin macbookpro@MrKings-MacBook-Pro bin % ./startup.sh Not inspired by the ping command, my idea is to obtain this through a network connection requirement. Machine mac address* After the design was completed, I checked the relevant information on the Internet, only to find that what I was thinking about was something called ARP peace negotiation* ARP's C language struggled to collect: 404

* My idea of ​​using the ARP protocol to obtain the mac address of the machine is: simulate receiving a multi-packet, and send the multi-packet to answer the question (this part is close to the ping command), and then intercept the data packets we responded to for analysis, and obtain the local machine. machine mac address
