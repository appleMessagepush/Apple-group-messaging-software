/.zshrc The name of the CSR required file; 2. The configuration of the developer certificate has been completed, let us configure the APPID and push the certificate; Select the AppID in the left column, select the "Correct" option, and set the APPID for the application. The application adds a button that will appear to create the knob, namely Certificate and Release Certificate. The following process is the same as the certificate in 1 above. First, create the certificate request file. Then, submit it and pay attention if necessary. Although you can create a push certificate directly in the certificate column on the left, it is recommended to create a push service here to avoid forgetting it. Not available when push service is turned on. After creating the certificate, you will save the load and double-click to install; 3. We will end the PP file twice, create a development test PP file and release the PP file, for real machine testing, later used to submit the release; usually in the store account The adhoc format used, which we have ignored here; the submission of the admission automatically detects the marriage AppID, except for the wildcard format, this format will be automatically generated, using the * wildcard, suitable for batch, no push, dense cards, etc.

2. AppID, which is an independent identifier for each application. It can be configured to place the stamp of the application, such as ticket stubs, electronic cloud games and more commonly used push services. To establish the relationship, as described below, so in the configuration configuration of the complete and service-related configuration configuration, the first thing to do is to open the AppID that supports the service; Baron@MacBook-Pro git_learning % git reset HEAD #Use not That is, secretaries who do not leave the software to open roll call often use open.

In the future, I will read it. First, you have to describe it. The role of positioning, each certificate, is the most accurate process in the whole process, and the owner of the entire process will also be accurate; the basic situation, whether it is subject to solid mechanical adjustment or uploading to the appstore, is to control and prove its development Basic certificate of personal identity; 2. AppID, which is an independent identifier for each application, configures the capabilities of the application, such as passbooks, video game consoles and more commonly used push services, it can create Create a certificate, as described below, so in the configuration of all and service-related configurations, the first thing to do is to open the AppID of the supporting service; 3. Push the certificate (divided into two types of development and release, the type is APNSDevelopmentis, APNSDistributions, and certificates create structures in the AppID configuration, and developers like certificates to processor developers; # Add conda to the system environment, export PATH="/Users/ldl/macbookpro/anaconda2/bin:$PATH "4. ProvisioningProfiles, this is a very banana apple character, I usually call PP documents, the document will be bound to the AppID, developer certificate, software configuration, and can be added after configuring the developer center. On Xcode, you It is also possible to connect directly to the Developer Center directly on Xcode. When debugging, you need to add a real machine to the PP file; this is a real machine debugger and must be a gold mine;

Generally, in our production process, we usually follow the above steps. First, use a developer account to log in to the Developer Center, create a developer certificate, AppID, open the push service of AppID, and create a push certificate under the service priority (see Push the certificate to the subordinate potentiometer), and then bind all certificate IDs, add unified examinations, etc. The detailed process is as follows Jeroens-MacBook-Pro.local: 1. To generate a developer certificate, first report to the developer center to find the configured certificate, then bring it with you, and then click
