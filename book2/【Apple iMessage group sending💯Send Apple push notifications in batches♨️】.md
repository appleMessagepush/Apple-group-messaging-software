We introduce the above configuration into our logback-spring.xml to achieve the default logging effect of Spring-boot. The corresponding code of the corresponding code of the LogBack-spring.xml response code: Then we start the project again. We'll find that outputting the previous logs has more to do with the original spring boot than the original spring boot. Configuration information spring logo. The rest of the information is equal. Through the above explanation, the HTTP log is AppendRapender, we guess: Appender can process the log as we want. While delving into civilian documents, we discovered many existing Appenders. Syslogappender is similar to our needs.

Less so than the need to control it; for the heap, release events are concocted by the programmer, and MemoryLeak control can easily occur. Control size: Warehouse: In Windows, a warehouse is a stack structure that extends to a low address, which is a continuous storage area. The meaning of this sentence is that the maximum storage capacity of the warehouse and the maximum traffic flow of the warehouse are reservation systems. In Windows, the stack size is 2M (multiple sentences are 1M, the summary fixed size is limited to the effective virtual memory in the microprocessor system. It can be seen that the space obtained is efficient and it is relatively large. .Classperson space.

Currently, it could be a local computer, Mike Virtual Machine, Mikescos Virtual Machine, Mikescas Virtual Machine... 4. Build the web environment during execution. , write the interface, and then call the virtual machine through the intranetip, successfully write the database through the script, and then read the database to display the results. There are many problems in construction and debugging. You need to debug. You can exchange them together.

//main.js
import pageHead from './components/page-head.vue' //Import
Vue.component('page-head', pageHead) //Register. After registration, you can directly use the <page-head></page-head> component in each vue page.
2. Install nvm and nodejs
nvm is a tool for nodejs version management and is used to install nodejs.
You should be able to use brew to install nvm directly, but I did not use this installation. Readers can try it themselves using the following command:

brew install nvm

According to the official instructions, this command should automatically set up the equipment and arrange the environment. The nvm command can be used in any terminal, but it cannot be done after I have installed it. If you need to do additional things, you need to add the following line to the ~/.bashrc, ~/.profile, ~/.zshrc files (if you have not created them yourself):

. ~/.nvm/nvm.sh

This way you can use the nvm command in any terminal.
Then execute the following command:

nvm install node && nvm alias default node

This is used to install nodejs and npm. npm is a tool used for nodejs package hosting management.
3. Install watchman
Watchman is a tool used to monitor file changes. It should be used to monitor file changes, and then the interface will respond accordingly. Execute the following command:

brew install watchman

4. Install flow
What I personally know about flow is a tool for static analysis of js syntax errors, which can detect js syntax errors earlier.

public abstract class AbstractMessage {

     private IMessage iMessage;

static init() {
     wx.getSystemInfo({
       success: function(res) {
         if (res.platform == "devtools") {
           SystemInfoUtil.platform = SystemInfoUtil.PC;
         } else if (res.platform == "ios") {
           SystemInfoUtil.platform = SystemInfoUtil.IOS;
         } else if (res.platform == "android") {
           SystemInfoUtil.platform = SystemInfoUtil.ANDROID;
         }
 
         let version = res.SDKVersion;
         version = version.replace(/\./g, "");
         SystemInfoUtil.wxSDKVersion = version;
       }
     })
   }

localhost:localhost:localhost:localhost:localhost:8081/log can be sent, but there is no group project level solution. But you can implement the following scenario! Since it is a batch process, each account is unlimited and can install many devices and AppleIDs by installing a virtual machine. 1. Install a VM virtual machine and install multiple MacOS systems in the virtual machine. You could just install a direct clone so it doesn't take up excessive memory and then log into each VM's Apple ID to use the lower version). If you install it, it will never be introduced online again.
